# Machine Learning for Image and Video Analysis

Hey there! I made this repo where I gathered everything I used for **"Analysis of images and videos"** subject in my fourth year
of Data Science degree at UPV. It's got all my notes for studying the boring theoretical exam 🥱 and all the stuff I did 
to smash 💥 the practical evaluation. The bad news is that both the theoretical content and the comments in the Jupyter
notebooks are in Spanish 🇪🇸💃🏽 since the subject was oficially taught in Spanish.

Although it's been almost two years since I finished my degree, I decided to upload this to my GitHub because I had
a blast 🤩 with this subject and I'm still really into this field of study.

> ##### All code is in Python3 using mostly Numpy and Image from PIL. The purpose was to develop the methods "by hand" despite the fact that there are already optimized builtin functions in certain libraries that give the same results.

In **Pract1** directory, you'll find the implementations I made for:

* <span style="color:purple">_Parte1:_</span> Bright and contrast, Stretching, Ecualizer and Local Ecualizer
* <span style="color:purple">_Parte2:_</span> Convolution, Contour detection filters (Sobel, Laplace, Roberts, Prewit)
* <span style="color:purple">_Parte3:_</span> Thresholding (Otsu) and Connected Components
* <span style="color:purple">_Parte4:_</span> Morphological Operators (Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing)
* <span style="color:purple">_Ejercicio1:_</span>Use the above methods to calculate and draw Minimum Bounding Boxes for a given image.
* <span style="color:purple">_Ejercicio2:_</span> Count the amount of coins on a given image using a combination of aforementioned methods.
